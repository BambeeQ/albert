<p><em><strong>Great news!</strong> - Finally albert got a QML frontend</em></p>

<p>QML makes the user interface even better in any aspect! The new frontend architecture allows you to not only set the theme of the frontend, but the design and behaviour too. The decarative nature of QML lets you design a UI in dozens to hundreds rather than hundreds to thouands of lines of code. Since QML is an interpreted language you can rapidly prototype new user interfaces in minutes. Integration of Javascript makes the user interface highly dynamic and predefined animations and behaviour makes implementing beauty a breeze. QML building blocks offer a wide variety of opportunities and hardly any limitations. This will allow albert to be whatever you like and integrate seamlessly in whichever environment you use.</p>

<p>If you are a techie, i&#39;d appreciate to receive a pull request with a nice styles. If you&#39;re not, there is still the possibility to customize the provided styles by changing the properties to your liking.</p>
