Great news! Finally albert got a QML frontend. This makes the UI even more flexible. QML allows to set not only the style of the frontend, but the markup and behaviour too. This will allow Albert to be whatever you like and integrate seamlessly in whichever environment you use. If you are a techie i'd appreciate to receive a pull request with a nice style. If you're not, there is still the possibility to customize the provided styles by changing the properties to you
